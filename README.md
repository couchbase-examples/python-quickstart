# Quickstart in Couchbase with Flask and Python

#### Build a REST API with Couchbase's Python SDK 3 and Flask

> This repo is designed to teach you how to connect to a Couchbase cluster to create, read, update, and delete documents and how to write simple parametrized N1QL queries.

Full documentation can be found on the [Couchbase Developer Portal](https://developer.couchbase.com/tutorial-quickstart-flask-python/).

## Prerequisites

To run this prebuilt project, you will need:

- Couchbase 7 Installed
- [Python v3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed
- Code Editor installed

### Install Dependencies

Dependencies can be installed through PIP the default package manage for Python.

```sh
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Database Server Configuration

All configuration for communication with the database is stored in the `.env` file in the src folder. This includes the connection string, username, password, bucket name, colleciton name, and scope name.

There is an example file `.env.example` that can be used as the template for the pararmeters for your environment. You can copy this file and fill in with the values corresponding to your environment.

Note: If you are running with [Couchbase Capella](https://cloud.couchbase.com/), you need to change the `connect()` method to use TLS (currently commented out). Also ensure that the bucket exists on the cluster and your [IP address is whitelisted](https://docs.couchbase.com/cloud/get-started/cluster-and-data.html#allowed) on the Cluster. We do not use Certificates for authentication in this tutorial for simplicity. However for production use cases, it is recommended to enable Certificates.

In order to initialize the scope and collection in the Capella cluster, you need to change the `initialize_db()` in `db_init.py` to use TLS (currently commented out).

## Running The Application

At this point the application is ready and you can run it. The bucket along with the scope and collection will be created on the cluster. For Capella, you need to ensure that the bucket is created before running the application.

```sh
cd src
python db_init.py && flask run
```

> \*Couchbase 7 must be installed and running on localhost (http://127.0.0.1:8091) prior to running the Flask Python app unless running Couchbase Capella.

## Running The Tests

To run the standard integration tests, use the following commands:

```sh
cd src
pytest test.py
```

## Conclusion

Setting up a basic REST API in Flask and Python with Couchbase is fairly simple. In this project when ran with Couchbase Server 7 installed, it will create a bucket in Couchbase, an index for our parameterized [N1QL query](https://docs.couchbase.com/python-sdk/current/howtos/n1ql-queries-with-sdk.html), and showcases basic CRUD operations needed in most applications.
